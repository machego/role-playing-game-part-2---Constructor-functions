Build a role - playing game part 2 - Constructor functions

1. Use a constructor function 1

Challenge 
1. Create a new constructor function called Character which
   takes our data as a parameter.
2. Set up "this" for each of the 5 properties in our objects
   (eg: this.health = data.health).


2. Use a constructor function 2

Challenge
1. Create a method called getCharacterHtml that performs the 
   same tasks as our current renderCharacter function.
2. Create two new instances of Character. One for a hero, 
   called "wizard", and one for a monster, called "orc". 
   Render both of them on the page.
3. Delete both the old renderCharacter function and the two 
   lines of code at the bottom of the page which invoke that 
   function.

3. Simplify constructor function 1

CHALLENGE
-Use what you learned in the previous scrim to
remove the following 5 lines of code


4. Simplify constructor function 2

CHALLENGE 
1. Add this function as a method of our character constructor
2. Make a small change to getCharacterHtml to make the app work again


5. Problem in the constructor function!

CHALLENGE
- instead of setting the innerHTML from right here in the contructor,
make it so that we just return that literal string of HTML
- This will break the app. Don't worry!


6. Fix the broken rendering

CHALLENGE
 - Make the wizard and orc render
 - check hint.md if you need a hand 

 /* MINI CHALLENGE */
 1 Create one render() function that calls both wizard and orc 
 so we can control when they render. 
 2 call the function.


7. Amalgamate the objects

CHALLENGE
-Create a new const called characterData and set it equals to an 
object which holds both our hero and monster objects. 

-Think about how we access the data from our new object
when we set up new characters down at the very bottom of the app. 
-See if you can work out what needs to change there to keep the 
app working.


8. Too much code for one file!


9. Export getDiceRollArray()

Challenge
1. Create a file called 'utils.js'.
2. Cut and paste the getDiceRollArray() function into it.
3. Decide if this should be a default or named export. Think
   about this!!
4. Import back it into index.js


10. Export Character constructor

Challenge
1. Create a file called 'Character.js'
2. Cut and paste the constructor function into it.
3. Decide if this should be a default or named export. Think
   about this!!
4. Import it into index.js
5. You will hit a problem! Solve the problem!


11. Running your code locally


12. Good housekeeping
